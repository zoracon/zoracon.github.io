Some years back I switched to Republic Wireless for my phone service. I stuck it out for two years, but the phone selection was minimum and I wasn't well versed on hardware at the time.
</p>

<p>
I switched to Google Fi and got the infamous Nexus 5X and dealt with it's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/01/31/lg-settles-bootloop-lawsuit-members-get-425-cash-700-lg-phone-rebate/">"bootloop of death"</a>. By the second 5X, I was fed up and by this time I realized I was in the era of "phone leases" or payout $600+ for the latest phone. Google Fi did offer about $300 off on a Pixel 2, but I did not want a Pixel 2 and wanted to weigh my options.
</p>

<p>
I had my eye on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/">Fairphone</a>, but they don't sell here in the U.S. Right now Apple and Google pretend that this fully modular phone does not exist and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm">isn't cost efficient.</a> :-/
</p>

<p>
I needed an intermediate solution before I shell out $300 for a new phone. I knew Google Fi piggy backed off networks towers used by Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular. I grew curious, because if phones that work with Sprint should work with this service right? Yes and no. I started doing some research and came across the term "Frequency Bands". You come across this when someone mentions "3G" or "4G". But there are other protocols and access methods involved. <a target="_blank" href="http://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers-products/11593/news/cdma-vs-gsm-whats-the-difference">Explained nicely in this article.</a>

<p>
There are two sides here. 1. Access points the phone can access 2. The access points the SIM card can access.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to take these two comparisons and see what intermediate cheap unlocked phone I could get. Google Fi says that phones not approved on the network won't really come with Google Fi's full support of features. But technically most phones with GSM, will mainly work with G-Fi. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frequencycheck.com">this site</a> to compare phones and settled on a $120 Nextbit Robin last year (they were bought out by Razer so no more iterations of the Robin). Security updates for Nextbit ends this month, so I will be on the hunt for a phone that serves my needs. I really want Fairphone makes it to the U.S.; and I have hope that the short sightedness of the smartphone realm in the U.S. doesn't ruin the chances of being able to buy modular phones and easily fix issues that have been plaguing less tech savvy people every where. Simply leasing phones does not solve the problem of people being generally uneducated about their phones. It actually widens the gap and will likely limit access to knowledge. Changing a battery should not be a momumental task.

<p>
I generally would like to still <em>own</em> my phone and leasing it can lead to the provider doing fuck all with your physical device and data on said phone. Since technically you would not own it. It could terminate the possibility of fixing your own phone and voiding the lease deal by doing so. I hope that future isn't imminent. Until then, fuck phone leases and hopefully services like Republic Wireless and Google Fi get people thinking about the possibility of phone co-ops in the U.S.
