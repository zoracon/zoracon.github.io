## Multi Media Messaging. What a Clusterfuck

For many years I have had problems with this format. Where images may not download. Or I simply would be blocked from downloading the MMS formatted message completely.

### Problems with MMS

- Each MMS capable phone may have their own format. The Open Mobile Alliance "owns" the MMS standard, but the way MMS is digested and formatted can differ from phone to phone.

- MMS is a subscriptio  n model for messaging a group of people. So once you are included in a mass text you have to "unsubscribe" in some way in order to get out of the MMS group. Some messengers handle this better than others.

- MMS media normally only allows media up to a certain size. So that explains the notorious low quality images and videos sent and recieved in MMS. Thanks to these issues, we are stuck in a hell of Group messaging apps. WhatsApp, GroupMe, Duo, etc. Thankfully, Signal, my preference for SMS handles these complexities pretty well despite the issues with MMS.

I have never used iPhone, but iMessage is the default pathway to deliver messsages within iOS, hence the higher quality. But this is a proprietary solution that does not transfer to Android. (Cue green vs. blue message bubbles wars)

Either way, it's 2020. I know the world is on fire. So MMS gods, get to this when you can.
