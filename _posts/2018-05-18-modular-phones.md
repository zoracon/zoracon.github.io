I have been on the hunt and hoping for a modular phone since I came across <a href="https://phonebloks.com/" target="_blank">Phone Bloks</a> in 2015 as a concept.

I have witnessed the evolution of being able to simply swap out batteries, to full complex processes of obtaining and replacing such a simple part of our phones. Becoming frustrated, I sought out different options. 
</p>

<p>
E-waste has been a major climate altering issue, but also a large indicator of how manufacturers and phone service companies have been strong arming the market of being completely dependent on them for a functioning phone.
</p>

<p>
What if you could fix your own phone?
</p>

<p>
What if you could simply replace processors if needed, a new camera, or modulate whatever parts needed as your life changes?
</p>

<p>
This is what modular phones can do. However, the phone manufacturers in the U.S. have been very quiet on this concept. When they were <a target="_blank" href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/03/why-google-canceled-project-ara/">finally loud about it, they shut it down as an unrealistic endeavor and never revisited it.</a>
</p>

<p>
I searched on the <a href="https://phonebloks.com/development" target="_blank">Phone Blok's site</a> for other concepts out there throughout the years but the only stable phone that really "made it" was the Fairphone; only sold in Europe. Technically, I can ask a friend in Berlin to possibly get one for me, but I wouldn't have consistent access to the modular parts. Defeating the purpose.

The current state of affairs in the U.S, simply trying to repair the current popular phone, such as the iPhone, has become a battlefield for the Right to Repair. The Right to Repair movement stemmed out of certain manufacturers like Apple, trying to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/02/apple-warranty-repair-practices-questioned-by-bbc-as-ftc-warning-looms/" target="_blank">"punish those for fixing parts from "unapproved parties",</a> and voiding their warranties. <a href="https://repair.org/legislation/>">Repair.org</a> leads the way to fight for the right to maintain devices and other machines at reasonable costs. Phones scratch the surface, but overall the focus of this post is to get the user to ask the question:
</p>

<p>On a scale from 1-10, how easy is it to replace your phone battery?</p>

<p>If you are not sure, I encourage you to check out a tear-down of your phone if available on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown" target="_blank">ifixit.org</a> and see for yourself. Even if you don't understand all the parts to your phone, you can at least know what is inside. Informing yourself ad hoc helps you understand what you look for in a phone. I for like ones that are well built and configurable, more than the sleekest design. To my dismay that is harder and harder to find.</p>

<p>So far I either move to Europe for a Fairphone or get the LG G5, which had a slide out battery. The options are limited but I did find a cool project by these fine people at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2070436562/kite" target="_blank">iSquare Mobility</a>. It's not a sleek modular concept but rather a DIY phone with a 3D printed shell. I hope this project gets traction and I currently want to get my hands on a kit <strike>before Google black bags them</strike>.
