    <h1>Stacks and Hardware:</h1>
    <p>@SITE: This site is statically generated on Jekyll and Github Pages. I will potentially move away from Github pages one day, but it's easier to toy with new web layouts and play with my more "pure" frontend skills here. I do not wish to use Javascript on this site. Just plain HTML & CSS.</p>
    
    <p>@PC: In 2020 my pandemic project became building my own PC up since my old Macbook had one foot in tech heaven. I learned how to program on it 11 years ago! So there is a lot of sentimenal value I had for it.
       But hey, I needed to run VMs. The build: 8-core AMD Ryzen 7, 32 GB of RAM (DDR4), 2 TB SSD, MSI Motherboard, 8GB Sapphire PULSE Radeon GPU. Yes, the GPU could be better but blame the cryptominers.
    </p>

    <p>@CLOUD: I run various self-hosted projects like my personal cloud. The best use I have gotten out of it is streaming my music library through my phone. When I add music to my cloud it can update on my phone's music player app (I use Poweramp).
      I am also able to have my own CardDAV & CalDAV servers. You can sync those contacts through the Android ecosystem without saving them to your Google account. I never had an issue outside of having to manually download .ics files for my calendar.
      ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯.
    </p>
    <p>I can also discuss "the big 3" in Cloud but for personal projects, I prefer Digital Ocean.</p>

    <p>@VPN: For about 3 years I have been running a VPN and I my fave at the moment is Wireguard. I used to run OpenVPN and Outline. This has been the fastest out of the 3.</p>

    <p>@CRYPTO: Professionally, I know way more about PKI than I ever wanted to. But please feel free to discuss practical cryptography with me. My favorite application of this subject is Keybase at the moment.</p>
  
    <p>@PI: I have a few Raspberry Pis laying around doing various things. But my favorite project so far is PiHole.</p>

    <p>@ARDUINO: Sensors and C++ == temperature + humidity sensor for my kid's room.</p>

    <p>@Network: It's kind of a mess, but a switch, a box of cat6, and segmentation went a long way in a place where they cut all the ethernet ports by accident and I just have the one coaxial port. Please send Fiber :(.</p>
